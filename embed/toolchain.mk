# Resolve the static build toolchain (clang, bpftool, esbuild, git, tsgo) — included
# by the project Makefile before build/bpf.mk, so the tools are set before any
# rule uses them. A `make CLANG=…` CLI override beats this.
#
# Tools come from a shared, per-machine cache keyed by the project's pinned
# toolchain version (build/toolchain.lock). `make toolchain` fills it,
# downloading each missing tool once from the vendored toolchain release
# (github.com/yeet-src/toolchain). The cache key is the toolchain version,
# never the template version — so updating the template reuses an existing
# cached toolchain, and bumping a tool adds a new entry beside the old one.
# Falls back to host tools on PATH when no lock is present.
